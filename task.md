@main.ts is executed automatically once per day as a cron job. Add in a new slack integration in a separate file. Then whenever this thing runs, check for orders that have been pending too long (more than 3 days) and send an alert to the #order-alerts channel with the customer name and phone number so someone can follow up. @schema.ts contains the current db structure. Remember, all queries should be placed in the ./queries dir. Start with the slack integration.
